## Description

This web application utilizes React for building the user interface and incorporates the Bootstrap framework for styling. The app showcases the use of Mapbox and Leaflet to create an interactive map that displays the real-time locations of buses in Rio de Janeiro. The map is centered on Rio de Janeiro, and bus location data is fetched from the cityhall's API to display bus markers on the map. It utilizes the Leaflet Markercluster plugin for efficient marker clustering.
